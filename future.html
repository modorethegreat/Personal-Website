                <p>Every project, every essay, every simulation I build is aimed at the same target: pushing humanity forward, both physically and mentally.</p>
                <p>With my upcoming exchange to TU Delft, a growing portfolio of simulation-driven research, and a personal manifesto in the works, I stand at the edge of something bigger than myself. I want to build a world where propulsion is smarter, faster, more human, and where freedom is not just a concept, but a way of life.</p>

                <!-- <p>I aim to build tools that empower humanity to go furtherâ€”technically, intellectually, and spiritually. My focus on research in <strong>MHD propulsion, hybrid nuclear systems (NTP/NEP), and AI-enhanced simulation pipelines</strong> is about creating a modular, real-time, intelligent engineering workflow for designing the engines of tomorrow.</p>
                <p>My upcoming exchange at <strong>TU Delft</strong> represents a significant milestone, not only for deepening my technical expertise but also for immersing myself in a culture of innovation and creative freedom. I am eager to contribute to and learn from the forefront of aerospace engineering.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, I want to be part of the generation that makes interplanetary travel more accessible and sustainable, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in space exploration.</p> -->
