                <h4>üß™ Data Scientist <span class="duration">Winter 2023</span></h4>
                <div class="company">Canadian Space Agency (CSA)</div>
                <p>During my co-op at the Canadian Space Agency, I worked in a highly interdisciplinary team responsible for vacuum chamber simulation experiments supporting aerospace research. My role focused on real-time systems integration and data intelligence.</p>
                <p><strong>Key contributions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Developed a Python/SQL dashboard to monitor multi-sensor data from thermocouples and pressure transducers in vacuum environments.</li>
                    <li>Automated failure detection workflows and implemented real-time alert notifications, reducing downtime by over 25%.</li>
                    <li>Visualized key environmental conditions (temperature, pressure, flow rates) using MATLAB and produced performance analytics for chamber experiments.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This role refined my ability to bridge hardware and data, laying a foundation for future systems diagnostics in propulsion chambers and spacecraft testing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="job card">
               <h4>üöÄ Propulsion Team Member <span class="duration">Since 2022</span></h4>
                <div class="company">University of Waterloo Rocketry Team</div>
                <p>Since 2022, I‚Äôve been a dedicated member of the Propulsion Team on the Waterloo Rocketry Team, where I‚Äôve worked on both solid and liquid-fueled engine systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Key responsibilities:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simulated rocket nozzle performance using ANSYS Fluent, optimizing geometry to improve thrust and reduce mass by 5%.</li>
                    <li>Designed mechanical components in SolidWorks, coordinated with structural and avionics teams, and helped draft detailed design reports and test protocols.</li>
                    <li>Analyzed static fire test data using MATLAB, contributing to the iterative improvement of nozzle efficiency and stability.</li>
                </ul>
                 <p>This experience not only developed my skills in CFD, FEA, and cross-disciplinary teamwork‚Äîit also grounded me in the real-world constraints of aerospace design.</p>

            <div class="job card">
               <h4>üß¨ R&D Scientist <span class="duration">Fall 2023</span></h4>
               <div class="company">Gay Lea Foods</div>
               <p>At Gay Lea Foods, I worked on the edge of data science and chemistry, applying my technical skills to predictive modeling and experimental design in food formulation.</p>
               <p><strong>Key outcomes:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used TensorFlow and scikit-learn to build models predicting product texture and chemical stability.</li>
                    <li>Automated assay data processing using pandas and NumPy, and ran MATLAB analysis to verify formulation performance against lab data.</li>
                    <li>Designed validation experiments using viscometers, moisture analyzers, and pH meters to ensure 95%+ product quality accuracy.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While not aerospace-related, this role deepened my command of data modeling, experimental design, and automated data pipelines, which translate directly into large-scale simulation workflows in engineering.</p>
