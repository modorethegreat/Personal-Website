                 <div class="bio card">
                     <p>My name is <strong>Mohamed Hassan</strong>, and I‚Äôm a fourth-year student at the University of Waterloo, majoring in Physics and Astronomy with a minor in Applied Mathematics, concentrating on fluids and heat transfer. My academic journey began long before university‚Äîshaped by an early fascination with space and a relentless drive to understand the universe at its most fundamental level.</p>
                     <p>Born in Atlanta, Georgia, and raised in Canada by a single mother, I grew up immersed in a mindset of resilience, independence, and quiet ambition. As a child, I often found myself staring at the night sky, wondering not just about what lies beyond, but how we might one day get there. That sense of wonder never faded‚Äîit evolved into a purpose: to design and optimize propulsion systems that will one day carry humanity deeper into space.</p>

                    <h3>‚úàÔ∏è TU Delft Exchange (Fall 2025)</h3>
                    <p>I‚Äôve been accepted to TU Delft for a semester-long academic exchange with the Faculty of Applied Physics, beginning Fall 2025. This milestone represents more than just an academic opportunity‚Äîit‚Äôs the next step in a life-long pursuit of space-bound innovation.</p>
                    <p>I was first introduced to TU Delft during a seminar at Waterloo, where my professor cited Professor Piero Colonna‚Äôs work on non-ideal compressible fluid dynamics (NICFD) and supercritical CO‚ÇÇ cycles‚Äîtopics that closely align with my own interests in next-generation propulsion technologies. From that point on, I knew TU Delft was the place where theory meets innovation.</p>
                    <p>While there, I plan to take courses in:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Computational fluid and thermal simulations</li>
                        <li>Quantum information</li>
                        <li>Energy storage systems</li>
                        <li>Nuclear physics</li>
                        <li>Propulsion and turbomachinery</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These areas were carefully selected to address specific knowledge gaps I‚Äôve mapped in my current skillset. My goal is to absorb TU Delft‚Äôs rich legacy in aerospace while also bringing my own background in AI-enhanced simulation, fluid dynamics, and thermodynamic modeling to the table.</p>
